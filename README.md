# OpenHPC-Setup

Please note that this project is not part of the OpenHPC community.  It is simply a project to help automate and simplify setting up OpenHPC on a simple Raspberry Pi cluster.

This project consists of two parts:  a simple shell script to install the basic packages needed to get started with OpenHPC setup,  and a small locally-hosted webpage to provide a GUI for setup.

TODO:
* Finish installation script
* Use Python for basic webserver
* Create webpage for configuration
